# Iterated Learning Model

Implementation of the Iterated Learner presented in the Kirby 2000 paper [1].

The software simulates a population attempting to articulate possible meanings
to each other.  Starting with an initial non-linguistic population, the
simulation shows how quickly the learners are educated and the language adjusts
to be fully expressive. It is then possible to analyse the resulting language as
a function of the initial arguments, and formulate conclusions on the
characteristics of various linguistic features.

This work is a part of my seminar paper for the course [0627-3777 Learning
Seminar: Computation and Cognition](http://www2.tau.ac.il/yedion/syllabus.asp?year=2012&course=0627377701).
